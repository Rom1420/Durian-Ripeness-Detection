# Durian Ripeness Detection – Project Overview

This repository contains a full pipeline for detecting and classifying durian fruit ripeness using deep learning models. It is structured into three main folders:

* `webapp/` – A React-based frontend application that allows users to upload images and view detection/classification results.
* `segmentation/` – Scripts and configuration files for fruit segmentation using YOLOv8.
* `classification/` – CNN training and evaluation scripts for fruit maturity classification on both cropped and original images.
